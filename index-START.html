// IN OTHER WORDS, WITH A STRING CHANGING THE ORIGINAL DOESN'T CHANGE THE COPY/REFERENCE

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
// BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND COPY/REFERENCE ARE CHANGED

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // const team2 = players.splice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3] = "Changed!"
    console.log(players, team5)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const person2 = person;
    // person2.nickname = 'Charlie';
    // console.log(person, person2);
// IN OTHER WORDS THE REFERENCE ADDS THE NEW ATTRIBUTE nickname TO THE ORIGINAL PERSON OBJECT;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Les Boss', nickname: 'Charlie', age: 12 })
    console.log(person, person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const person3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

// IN OTHER WORDS Object.assign() WILL NOT COPY objects {} within objects {}.  SO IF YOU GO TO MODIFY THE inner object { social: {HERE} } OF THE COPY, YOU WILL MODIFY THE ORIGINAL.

const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

// HERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE BUT WES DOES NOT NECESSARILY RECOMMEND IT; NOT SURE ABOUT PERFORMANCE BUT IT'S A NEAT TRICK

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
